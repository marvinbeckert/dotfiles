# dotfiles
.dotfiles for my machine. I hope it works....

run to clone:  
`git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/whatwouldmarvindo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

then to install 
`cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install` 

You must also install custom plugin and theme (syntax-highlighting and powerlevel10k)
