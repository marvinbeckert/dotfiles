# dotfiles
.dotfiles for my machine. I hope it works....

run to clone:  
`git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/whatwouldmarvindo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`

then to install 
`cd ~/.dotfiles && ./install` 

If you don't have vim installed then change the default editor for git commits with:
> Change "editor_name" to whatever editor you have like nano, vi or vscode

`git config --global core.editor editor_name`
